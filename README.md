# Playtime
**Playtime** is a _xorganizational_ **runtime** and **DSL** (Domain Specific Language) for _expressing_ and _experimenting_ with organization inspired by the **role-oriented programming** language paradigm.

**Playtime** provides **interfaces** for **players** to _offer_ **play-role-castings** (_casting_ **elements/players/plays** into **roles**), to _recognize_ the **role-play requirements** for **elements** to _play_ certain **roles**, and to _utilise_ the **scripts** of their **roleâ€™s interface**.

**Playtime** provides interfaces for recognizing attributes of elements (such as **players, plays, roles, scripts, performances, points, rewards**, the **satisfaction/non-satisfaction** of the **role-play requirements** for **play-role-castings** etc.) and provides **interfaces** for _viewing_ **elements** from multiple (even _transitively-constructed_) **perspectives**.

Accordingly, the same **play** when _viewed_ from different **perspectives** can be _composed_ of entirely different **roles**, **scripts**, **role-players, role-play requirements, point/reward distributions**, etc.

## Playnet
**Playtime creation** is a **performance** of the **playnet**.

**Playnet** _xorganizes_ (_expresses/experiments_ with the **organization** of) **plays** (playful organizational forms) and **interfaces** (analog, digital, natural, social, material, ecological, communicational, economic etc.) that _augment_ the **capacities** of **players** to _**recognize, read, (re)-write,**_ and _**perform**_ **plays** for _creating_ **valuable effects**.

We **playtime creators** believe **playtime** to be an expression that alligns with the **valued effects** of the **playnet** in _augmenting_ the **capacities** of **players** to _**recognize, read, (re)-write,**_ and _**perform**_ **plays** for _creating_ **valuable effects**.

### Goblins
Built on top of **[Goblin's distributed object programming environment]([url](https://spritely.institute/goblins/))**. **Playtime** - and **organizations/games** expressed through it - can easily be **distributed, P2P,** and can **run in the browser.**

**Goblins** provides an intuitive security model, automatic local transactions for locally synchronous operations, and an easy to use and efficient asynchronous programming interface for encapsulated objects which can live anywhere on the network. **Goblins** also integrates powerful distributed debugging tools, and a process persistence and upgrade model which respects its security fundamentals.

## Run Playtime Environment

Here's how you can run the kitchen dish washing play:

```
guile --fresh-auto-compile  -s playtime.scm playtime-syntax/examples/kitchen.play
```

## Guile Hoot Game Template

This repository is the quickest way to get started building games in
Scheme that run in web browsers with Guile Hoot!

It has everything you need:

* A simple Breakout clone to use as a starting point.

* HTML and JavaScript boilerplate for running the game in a web page.

* DOM bindings for events, images, audio, and more.

* HTML5 canvas bindings for rendering.

* Some simple but useful game math modules.

* A `Makefile` for compiling the game to WebAssembly, running a
  development web server, and generating zip bundles for publishing to
  itch.io.

* A Guix `manifest.scm` file for creating a development environment
  with `guix shell`.

## Tutorial

The fastest way to get everything you need is to use [GNU
Guix](https://guix.gnu.org), a wonderful package manager written in
Scheme.

Once you have Guix, the development environment with all necessary
dependencies can be created:

```
guix shell
```

To build the game, run:

```
make
```

To launch a development web server, run:

```
make serve
```

To check if the program works, visit https://localhost:8088 in your
web browser.  We recommend using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
Hoot is not supported on Safari at this time.

When it's time to publish the game to itch.io, run:

```
make bundle
```

Upload the resulting zip file to your itch.io game page and share your
game with others!  Have fun!

### Guix on Mac (At your own risk)

It is possible to set up a virtual machine in which Guix is available. However, you'd still need to transfer the code of this repository to that box in order to benefit from it. Alternatively, read the instructions for a manual installation of dependencies in the following section.

If you want to give it a try, follow the instructions here to install msg, a Guix environment for Mac: https://superkamiguru.org/projects/msg.html

Then run the following commands in order to set up and connect to the virtual machine in which Guix is available:

```
msg machine init
msg machine start
msg shell
```

### Manual installation of dependencies on Mac (Recommended)

Follow the instructions here to install Hoot: https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot

Also add the following path exports to your ~/.bashrc or similar:

```
export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/opt/homebrew/share/guile/site/3.0"
export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache"
export GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/guile/3.0/extensions"
```

You also need to install Guile Goblins:

```
brew tap aconchillo/guile
brew install guile-goblins
```

When loading the goblins module, if you get segfaults or errors related to guile-fibers, install it from a tar ball (https://github.com/wingo/fibers) and update your GUILE_LOAD_PATH and GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH accordingly.

## Guile Goblins

See https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html for an intro. It uses Wisp syntax whose main feature is that instead of using parentheses for separating expressions from each other, it uses linebreaks. See https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html#appendix-lisp-wisp.
